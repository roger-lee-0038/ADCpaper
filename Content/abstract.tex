	Energy efficiency is the primary design constraint for deep-learning empowered edge intelligence. Sensory data, such as visual and audio, are known to be redundant in nature. Harnessing such redundancy through adaptive resolution is a promising approach to reducing energy costs. However, existing Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), the first line of edge analytics pipeline, are equipped with fixed precision capabilities, which have become a barrier to energy-efficient adaptive sensing and computation.  
	
	This paper presents an adaptive- precision ADC architecture to enable energy-efficient adaptive data sensing and computing for edge devices. The proposed design leverages a fine-grained power gating strategy to enable efficient and implementation-friendly run-time precision adaptation. The proposed method has been applied to widely used column-parallel ADCs, with two ADC design studies targeting data-intensive CMOS image processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce ADC power consumption by approximately 50\% with only a few required control circuits.
