Energy efficiency is the primary design constraint for deep-learning empowered edge intelligence. Sensory data such as visual and audio are known to be redundant in nature. Exploiting such redundancy through adaptive precision is a promising approach to minimizing energy costs. However, as the first line of data sensing, existing analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are equipped with fixed-precision capabilities, preventing the adoption of energy-efficient adaptive data analysis pipeline. 
	
	This paper presents an adaptive-precision ADC architecture to enable energy-efficient adaptive data analysis pipeline for edge devices. The proposed design utilizes a fine-grain power gating strategy to enable efficient and easy-to-implement run-time data precision adaptation. The proposed method has been applied to widely used column-parallel ADCs, with two ADC design studies targeting data-intensive CMOS image processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce ADC energy consumption by approximately 50\% while minimizing control circuit requirements.
