\section{Discussions}\label{discussion}
Combining adaptive-precision with fine-grained power gating strategies, both the SS ADCs and SAR/SS ADCs can save energy dynamically and significantly with only a few required control circuits. 
It is because that in the column-parallel and SS-logic-adopted ADCs, not only a large amount of currents can be under control but also the power gated time can be continously long. 

In comparison, the SAR/SS ADCs can support higher quantization bits and require fewer extra control circuits for the adaptive-precision, 
while SS ADCs inherently require less area and can be applied to the 4/8-bit situation more effectively. 
Therefore, according to specific design specifications, different structures can be chosen. 

For other different precision configurations and number of parallel collumns, 
the corresponding power consumption and energy-saving performance can also be estimated with extending the evaluation results in Sect.~\ref{result}.
