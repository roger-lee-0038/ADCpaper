Low-precision deep-learning algorithms have been extensively studied \cite{leibe_xnor-net_2016} \cite{li_ternary_2016}\cite{park_energy-efficient_2018} for better energy efficiency. \cite{leibe_xnor-net_2016} introduced Binary Weight Nets (BWN) and XNOR-Nets to realize
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with binary weights and activations. 
with some precision-compensation strategies, BWN and XNOR-Nets are able to do low-precision computing with only 0.8\% and 11\% accuracy loss, respectively.
\cite{li_ternary_2016} adopted weights of three values (i.e., -w, 0, w) for further reducing the computing-accuracy loss. Although this requires an additional bit per weight compared to binary weights, the sparsity of the weights (by zeros) can be exploited to reduce computation and storage cost.
\cite{park_energy-efficient_2018} presented an outlier-aware accelerator performing dense and low-precision (4-bit) computations for a majority of data, while efficiently handling a small number of sparse and high-precision outliers.
Although these works are about downstream low-precision algorithms and relatively seprated from the ADCs, the adaptive-precision solution design for ADCs need to take the precision requirements of the algorithms into consideration. In this paper, making trade off between the energy-saving capabilities and accuracy loss, we choose 4-bit conversion for the low-precision mode of the ADCs.

There have also been related works on precision-adaptive ADC design \cite{zhu_06_2013}\cite{zhu_6--10-bit_2015}\cite{el-halwagy_100-mss5-gss_2018}. \cite{zhu_06_2013} and \cite{zhu_6--10-bit_2015} focused on a single SAR ADC with capacitor-seprable digital-to-analog array for 8-10-bit or 6-10 bit adaptive-precision.
However, a SAR ADC is not suitable for image processing applications where high throughput is required thus the ADCs are usually in column-parallel style, where the Single-Slope(SS)
architecture is widely adopted to avoid overhead of area and power consumption.  
The ADC in \cite{zhu_6--10-bit_2015} employs a reconfigurable time-to-digital converter (TDC) that can be configured as a double sampling SAR-TDC for the high-resolution modes or as a 4× asynchronous time-interleaved flash-TDC for the high sampling rate modes. The ADC supports continuous sampling rate variations and providing 13–5-bit
adaptive-precision with exponential power scaling. This work demonstrated that the time-domain ADC allows for a wide range of reconfigurability, but the proposed implementation requires relatively complex extra control circuits. 
In this paper, considering that the extra control circuits in column-parallel ADCs have to be as simple as possible for avoiding area overhead and the energy-efficiency is the primary design constraint, we put aside adjustments for the ADCs' sampling rate or supply voltage, and focus on adopting implementation-friendly fine-grained power gating strategies between a full-precision mode and a low-precision mode of the ADCs, while the power scaling potential have also been effectively exploited thanks to the time-domain SS conversion logic.

Other works have dynamically adjusted the the camera’s resolution\cite{lubana_digital_2018} or clock frequency\cite{likamwa_energy_2013}for more efficeient image processing, but the precision of ADCs has not been considered as a variable. Besides, there are efforts trying to relieve the design specifications of ADCs by applying low-precision analog computing firstly close to the sensor \cite{likamwa_redeye_2016}\cite{chen_asp_2016}\cite{liu_ns-cim_2020}. 
But high-precision ADCs and DNN processors are still there for complex tasks. Therefore, taking adaptive-precision adjustments inside ADCs remains competitive for efficient hardware reuse..
