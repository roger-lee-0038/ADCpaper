\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusion}

In this work, an adaptive-precision ADC architecture to enable energy-efficient adaptive data sensing and computing for edge devices is proposed with implementation-friendly fine-grained power gating strategies.

According to the evaluation results of two CIS-applied column-parallel ADC designs, almost a half of the ADCsâ€™ power consumption can be reduced for low-precision conversion, 
while only a few of extra control circuits is required.
It is because that in the column-parallel ADCs where the SS conversion logic is widely adopted, not only a large amount of currents can be under control but also the power gating time can be continous and exponentially scalable. 

As the proposed architecture may resonate with varying downstream deep-learning algorithms for efficient multi-tasks analysis, further works on the co-design of ADCs and algorithms remain to be developed for more intelligent edge computing in the future.
