\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusion}

In this work, an adaptive-precision ADC architecture to enable energy-efficient adaptive data sensing and computing for edge devices is proposed with fine-grained power gating strategies.
According to the evaluation results of two CIS-applied column-parallel ADC designs, almost a half of the ADCsâ€™ power consumption can be reduced for low-precision conversion, 
while only a few of extra control circuits is required.

The method in this paper may resonate with varying downstream deep-learning algorithms for efficient multi-tasks analysis. 
As such an integrated system will be promising for more intelligent edge computing in the future, further works on the co-design of ADCs and NNs remain to be developed.
