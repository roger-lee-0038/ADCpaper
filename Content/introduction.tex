\section{Introduction}

Battery powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as wearables, have been playing an important role in people's daily lives.
In recent years, the adoption of deep learning algorithms on IoT devices are becoming increasingly prevalent to empower edge
intelligence, such as machine vision, speech recognition, and robotics applications. Content-rich deep models are data and energy 
intensive, limiting their applications in energy-constrained, battery-operated IoT devices. There is an urgent need to tackle the 
energy challenge to support and sustain the fast expansion of artificial intelligence of things.

It is a known fact that feature-rich content, such as video and voice, has high data redundancy. Leveraging such data redundancy
can potentially reduce the computation and energy cost. To this end, adaptive-precision computing strategies have recently been 
proposed to improve the system energy efficiency. Zhao {\it et al.} proposed a deep reinforcement learning based adaptive-resolution 
framework for multi-task video analytics~\cite{zhao_reinforcement-learning-based_2022}. Lubana and Dick presented Digital Foveation, an energy-aware machine vision framework processing images in multiple rounds with adaptive-resolution~\cite{lubana_digital_2018}. LiKamWa {\it et al.} dynamically optimized the camera clock frequency for trade off between the sensing quality and energy efficiency~\cite{likamwa_energy_2013}.
While the recently proposed adaptive-precision computing techniques can effectively reduce the computation cost, Analog-to-digital 
converters (ADCs), as the the first line of the edge analytics pipeline, are equipped with fixed data precision capabilities, and
dominate the energy consumption of the data sensing stage of edge computing. For instance, as demonstrated in the previous study, 
such fixed-precision ADC design may introduce significant energy overhead to data sensing and communication, accounting for 50\%-75\% of overall energy in the image sensers~\cite{choi_energyillumination-adaptive_2015,takayanagi_125-inch_2005,kitamura_33-megapixel_2012}, and 34\% 
of the total machine vision analytics pipeline with backend digital hardware acceleration~\cite{likamwa_redeye_2016}.

This work introduces adaptive-precision ADC architecture design to tackle the energy efficiency challenge of edge intelligence. 
The proposed design leverages a fine-grained power gating strategy to enable efficient and implementation-friendly run-time precision 
adaptation. The proposed method has been applied to widely used column-parallel ADCs, with two ADC design studies targeting 
data-intensive CMOS image processing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce ADC power consumption 
by approximately 50\% with only a few required control circuits. This work makes the following contributions. 

%While more and more deep-learning algorithms have harnessed the redundancy of sensory data to improve the energy efficiency through precision-adaptive computing \cite{leibe_xnor-net_2016}\cite{li_ternary_2016}\cite{park_energy-efficient_2018}, 

%of edge devices, are still generally equipped with fixed precision capabilities. Therefore, opportunities have been offered for adaptive-precision tuning within the ADCs to further lower the energy barrier of edge sensing and computation. 
%and implementation with CIM architecture \cite{chiu_4-kb_2020}\cite{karunaratne_-memory_2020}\cite{jung_crossbar_2022} have been extensively studied, 
%can also be precision-adaptively designed for more intelligent edge computing.
%can also be smartly designed for more intelligent edge computing. 

%As the NN models have been able to process data of varying precision for efficient multi-task analysis [xxxx], opportunities have been offered for us to further improve 
%the systems' energy efficiency by taking algorithm-aware adjustments inside the ADCs. Considering the precision (i.e. the quantization bits) is at the heart of an ADCâ€™s energy constraints, 
%making it dynamically adaptive will be promising.

\begin{enumerate}[\IEEEsetlabelwidth{3)}]
	\item 
	An adaptive-precision ADC architecture is proposed to enable energy-efficient adaptive data sensing and computing for edge devices. The proposed design leverages a fine-grained power gating strategy to enable efficient and implementation-friendly run-time precision adaptation.
	Several auxiliary circuits have been carefully inserted to eliminate potential metastability caused by power gating. And the additional control signals are reused as much as possible or even not required, achieving cost-effective power-scaling capability exploitation inherently for the proposed ADC architectures.
	\item 
	The proposed method has been applied to widely used column-parallel ADCs targeting data-intensive CMOS image processing~\cite{kim_11-bit_2021,nie_single_2020,kumagai_14-inch_2018,park_640_2020}, with two case study ADC designs, including 
	a column-parallel Single-Slope (SS) ADCs~\cite{snoeij_18v_2005,kleinfelder_10000_2001} and a column-parallel Successive Approximation Register (SAR)/SS ADCs~\cite{kim_area-efficient_2016}. 

%	Both of the two architectures are completely built with not only main functional modules but also peripheral circuits including bandgap circuits, bias circuits and necessary buffers. And the ADCs' energy distribution across different modules is analysed  in detail. 
	%Two case study ADC designs applied in the CISs are presented with different design specifications.
    %according to which a method combining adaptive precision and fine-grained power gating strategies is proposed
    %for more smart data conversion.   

	\item 
	Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce ADC power consumption by approximately 50\% with only a few required control circuits.

	%Although with different design specificaitons, the proposed method is successfully applied to the two ADC architectures with the same principles, which shows universalty. Besides, the strengths and weaknesses of the two diffenrent architectures are specifically discussed.
