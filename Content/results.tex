\section{Evaluation Results}\label{result}

This section provides quantitative results on the fundamental characteristics and energy-saving performance of the two case study ADC designs. 
The ADCs are designed with TSMC 65nm process and simulated in Virtuoso’s AMS Environment. 
The power consumption is analysed according to the average transient current of different ADC modules, with one complete sampling and conversion period.
The input testing signals for low-precision conversion are the same as that for high-precision conversion and thereby given the ADC architecture, the power-saving performance is calculated fairly between the two modes of different precision.

Although some digital modules are behavioral-level written in Verilog, we consider the power dissipation of these parts to be negligible 
since these digital modules are just in need of limited dynamical current.

\subsection{Evaluation of the SS ADCs}

The fundamental characteristics of the SS ADCs are summarized in Table~\ref{tab1}. Assuming a 512×512 pixel array, the frame rate will be 162fps.
The SNDR of SS ADCs is 23.83/46.64 dB, which means the ENOB is 3.67/7.46 bits. 
The power consumption of the SS ADCs is measured and divided by column, 
it shows that compared to 76.2uW/column for high-precison conversion, only 40.8uW/column is needed for low-precison conversion, reduced by nearly half. 
A more specific energy distribution analysis is presented in Fig.~\ref{SSresults1}. 
As we can see, most of the power consumption is taken up by the column-parallel comparators and the output buffer of the ramp generator, 
both of which can be effectively power gated for low-precison conversion. 
The related quantity results is presented in Fig.~\ref{SSresults2}, 
where the peripheral circuits include a bandgap and voltage divider, some level-shift circuits and global buffers.

\subsection{Evaluation of the SAR/SS ADCs}

The fundamental characteristics of the SAR/SS ADCs are summarized in Table~\ref{tab2}. 
While the throughput is set similar to the SS ADCs, fewer steps is required in the SAR/SS ADCs, where 1 step is equivalent to 2 clock periods. 
The SNDR is 24.25/57.87 dB and the ENOB is 3.74/9.32 bits, which is in line with the design specifications. 
The power consumption is 256.1uW/column for high-precison conversion and 137.1uW/column for low-precison conversion. It means the energy of the SAR/SS ADCs can also be saved by nearly half for low-precison conversion.
According to the energy distribution analysis presented in Fig.~\ref{SARresults1}, most of the SAR/SS ADCs' power consumption is occupied by the column-parallel buffers of reference voltages in the sub-ADCs. And these parts of power consumption can be significantly reduced by power gating.
The related quantity results is presented in Fig.~\ref{SARresults2}.
