\section{Evaluation Results}\label{result}

This section presents quantitative evaluation results of the proposed adaptive-precision ADC 
designs, including a column-parallel Single-Slope (SS) ADC and a column-parallel successive 
approximation register (SAR)/SS ADC. Both ADC designs are implemented using TSMC 65nm processing,
and simulated in Virtuosoâ€™s AMS Environment. Circuit power consumption is collectively estimated
based on the average transient current of different ADC modules given one complete sampling and 
conversion period. Power savings are then estimated by comparing the power consumption of the
low-precision conversion mode against that of the high-precision conversion mode. 

Specifically, the detailed power-breakdown and power-saving results of the proposed SS and SAR/SS ADC designs are presented in \ref{SS power} and \ref{SAR power}. And the key design characteristics are summarized in \ref{summary}, with a comparison between our work and previous reported configurable ADCs.

\subsection{Power-scaling Performance of the SS ADC Design}\label{SS power}
%Table~\ref{tab1} summarizes the key design characteristics of the SS ADC design. Considering a 
%$512\times512$ pixel array, the frame rate is 162fps.  The SNDR of the SS ADC is 23.83/46.64 dB, 
%which means the ENOB is 3.67/7.46 bits.  

Fig.~\ref{SSresults1} shows the detailed power-breakdown results of the SS ADC design,
which demonstrates that the power consumption of the SS ADC design is mainly contributed by 
the column-parallel comparators and the output buffer of the ramp generator, both of which 
can be effectively regulated via power gating for low-power conversion. The peripheral circuits include a bandgap and voltage divider, level-shift circuits and global buffers.

The power-saving results are also presented in Fig.~\ref{SSresults2}, where the annotated power consumption is measured and divided by column. It shows that the total power consumption of the low-precision conversion mode is 40.8uW/column, and the power consumption of the high-precision conversion mode is 76.2uW/column. 
Compared to the high-precision conversion mode, the low-precision conversion mode can reduce 
the power consumption approximately 50\%, which is contributed by the power-gating-regulated comparators and buffer.

\subsection{Evaluation of the SAR/SS ADC design}\label{SAR power}

%Table~\ref{tab2} summarizes the key design characteristics of the SAR/SS ADC design, for which 
%we consider the same setup as that of the SS ADC. Since fewer steps are required in the SAR/SS ADC 
%design, 1 step is equivalent to 2 clock periods. The SNDR is 24.25/57.87 dB and the ENOB is 3.74/9.32 bits, 
%which is inline with the design specifications. 

Fig.~\ref{SARresults1} shows the detailed power-breakdown results of the SAR/SS ADC design, which 
demonstrates that the power consumption of the SAR/SS ADC design is mainly contributed by the column-parallel buffers of the reference voltages in the sub-ADCs, and power gating can effectively minimize the power consumption of these 
power-dominant components. 

The power-saving results are also presented in Fig.~\ref{SARresults2}, showing that the total power consumption of the SAR/SS ADC design is 256.1uW/column for the high-precision conversion mode and 137.1uW/column for the low-precision conversion mode. 
Compared to the high-precision conversion mode, the low-precision conversion mode can reduce the power consumption approximately 50\%.

\subsection{Performance Summary and Comparison}\label{summary}

Table~\ref{tab1} summarizes the key characteristics of the proposed SS and SAR/SS ADC designs.
And a comparison with previous reported configurable ADCs is also provided. 
We take the precision-adaptive SAR ADCs into the comparison because they have similar precision and sampling rate configurations to our design, and given a relatively loose area constraint SAR ADCs are also applicable to column-parallel image processing.

It is highlighted that our design achieves better power-scaling performance than previous reported ADCs. And the presented power-scaling percents of the SAR ADCs can be actually worse because in these works only the power consumption of the core ADC circuit is measured, while we have considered the power concumption of the whole implementation, including the bandgap, voltage divider, bias circuits and reference buffers. Therefore,     

showing that this work can achieve similar power-scaling performance to \cite{zhu_6--10-bit_2015}, while the power consumption of reference voltages is not included in \cite{zhu_6--10-bit_2015}. In addition, easier-to-implement control logic is required in our design. \cite{el-halwagy_100-mss5-gss_2018} actually focused on dynamically adjusted the ADC's sampling rate rather than power consumption with adaptive-precision, %since this work targeted the transceiver for different communication standards. 
Therefore, given the three typical different precision modes in \cite{el-halwagy_100-mss5-gss_2018}, the power consumtion actually increases as the precision decreases. 

It is noted that only this work is targeting image processing in the edge devices, and given a $512\times512$ pixel array, the corresponding frame rate applying the proposed 512-column-parallel SS and SAR/SS ADC designs will be 162fps and 193fps. Although the overall power consumption in our design can be further scaled down, the power-saving effectiveness with adaptive-precision is fairly demonstrated.
